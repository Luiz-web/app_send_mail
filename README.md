<h2 style="text-align: center; color: black;">Introduction</h2>
<p>The original source of this project is from a <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/web-completo/">Web Development</a> course on Udemy, which I made little changes, Involving the class I've developed to use the <a href="https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer">PHPMailer Library</a>.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center; color: black;">About the project</h2>
<p>This project consists of sending emails through a PHP code with the PHPMailer library, configured to send through a gmail address inserted. <br/>
On index.php, there is a form where you insert the recipient, the subject and the message of the email, and the page will return the information, whether the email was sent or not.</p>
